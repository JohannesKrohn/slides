                            p.copy The Design system can support projects through all phases.
                            p.copy To start #[b ideation, prototyping] or while doing a #[b design sprint] we provide a sketch library that gives you a head start with the majority of atoms and many important UI Patterns layed out.
                            p.copy #[b eon.frontify.com] also provides a project space for aligning in agile ways.

                            p.copy From our previous evolution of the design system we learned, that being to specific with the technology can render our code snippets obsolete.
                            p.copy With this iteration we went through the pain of re-doing many components and put them under the microscope to make the web components robust, up to date and versatile.
                            p.copy The new release creates the link between design assets and web components. Many of the design patterns are also available 1:1 as a web component so no development, reviewing and signing off is needed.
